Hello. My name is Nathan Lincoln. I'm a full-stack web developer with a passion for developer tooling and framework wars. I love using docker (I can't imagine working on a project without it now). 

Currently I work at [IntelliFarms](https://intellifarms.com) on our customer platform.

`dock up` refers to the command I use to start up my development environment (I have `docker-compose` aliased to `dock`)
